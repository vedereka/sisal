The content of initial thorium is considered minimal and no correction was needed.

89,"Gib04a (entity_id = 182): The age model was based on counting back annual cycles in d13C which were known to be forced by reversing seasonal ventilation from cave monitoring. Annual cycles in d13C mapped onto the paired laminae. Minima in d13C represents calcite deposited in late winter (April). The age model was validated by the position of the radiocarbon bomb peak and a high correlation between the d18O of net winter calcite and the corresponding weighted mean of monthly rainfall from the GNIP record.

92,"Keklik1 (entity_id = 185): The DCF is not known. However the method used for age-depth modelling is independent of the knowledge of the DCF and its secular variations.  All measured proxies (d18O, d13C and Sr/Ca) show no long term trend, indicating that the DCF is stationary and justifying this approach. The individual 14C ages were not necessary to calibrate to obtain a reasonable age depth relationship. Corr_age, corr_age_uncert_pos and corr_age_uncert_neg were not used for age-depth modeling. Do not use those values for any new remodelling of an age-depth relation. Age-depth modelling followed the procedure proposed in Lechleitner et al. (2016, QG, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quageo.2016.05.006 ). The raw isotope values are thought to be largely influenced by in-cave fractionation effects.

The age models of 46322, 46330-a, 46330-b, 46861, 50100, 142819, 142820 (entity_id = 624, 625, 630, 626, 627, 628, 629) are based on ages not corrected for detrital thorium."
280,"Entity AH-1 (entity_id = 639): Original age model not in the database because of the existence of age inversions. The sisal_chronologies for entity_id = 639 were run manually."
281,"ISO-1 (dating_depth = 0mm, dating_id = 11393) from entity V1 (entity_id = 640) is derived from isochron subsamples A (dating_id = 11390), B (dating_id = 11391) and C (dating_id = 11392). ISO-2 (dating_depth = 314.5mm, dating_id = 11402) from entity V1 (entity_id = 640) is age derived from isochron subsamples 124 (dating_id = 11399), 125 (dating_id = 11400) and 126 (dating_id = 11401). ISO-1 (dating_id = 11393) and ISO-2 (dating_id = 11402) were corrected with the initial 230Th/232Th ratio derived from the isochrones. For the other non-isochron samples, the authors chose an initial 230Th/232Th ratio between both isochrones. Age model of entity V1 (entity_id = 640) constructed using a fifth-order polynomial visually weighted to follow the most robust age determinations."
282,"Entity WS-5d (entity_id = 691) does not have age model in original publication. The sisal_chronologies for entity_id = 691 were run manually"
286,"The elevation of the cave (85 masl) differs with the elevation of the lower gallery from which La Garma speleothems were collected (59 masl). The C14 data (not provided here) is available in Rudzka et al., 2011 (10.1016/j.gca.2011.05.022). GAR-01_drill (entity_id=650) and GAR-01_laser data (entity_id= 651 and 652) were obtained from GAR-01 stalagmite using a handheld conventional drill (drill) at ~2.2 mm spatial resolution and by laser ablation (LA-GC-IRMS) with a ~500 micron resolution. GAR-01_laser_d13C (entity_id=652) and GAR-01_laser_d18O (entity_id=651) series are treated separately in the database because there is a small non-constant offset in the corresponding age-depth models. Baldini et al., 2015 (10.1016/j.epsl.2015.03.015) used the StalAge Algorithm but the ages determined using COPRA are provided here. There is excellent agreement between the two age models over the Younger Dryas Interval (see Baldini et al., QSR, in review).   "
287,"Entity TF-2 (entity_id = 653): Dating information at 195mm (dating_id = 11564) is not published. Primary data sheet supplied to SISAL has TIMS ages at 33mm (dating_id = 11562) and 130mm (dating_id=11563) that appear 4 years younger than what is published in Williams et al., 2005. The latter have been used here."
288,"WN-4 (entity_id = 654): The dating_id=11567 at 205mm used to calculate interp_age differs from published data by 18 years. WN-11 (entity_id = 655): There is a discrepancy of up to 5 years in the corr_ages with respect to published values. The corr_ages presented here are those used to create the original_chronology fields."
292,"Entity KTR-2 (entity_id = 671): Despite the mentioned presumed minor hiatus in the original paper, this has not been added here following authors' suggestion. The thickness of the limestone varies from a few tens to a few hundred meters, see original reference. According to Peter Rowe, a negative age uncertainty of -39 yrs  was erroneously reported by StalAge at interp_age 10642.62 yr BP (dating_id = 400608). This has not been entered here."
293,"Entity TM-17 (entity_id = 672): U/Th date at 27mm (dating_id = 11833) was not used in age model due to high uncertainty. The chronology was constructed from continuous Sr laminae anchored to the U-Th dates. Age-depth model uncertainties include the layer counting errors as well as the average LC error of 3% propagated between the U-Th error bars (see supplementary material of publication for details). Corrected ages assume the initial 230Th/232Th atomic ratio of 5.38 with a positive uncertainty of 5.38 and a negative uncertainty of 4.84 ppm. "
294,"Entity PA-2b (entity_id = 684): Isotope samples at 127 and 127.5mm removed because of their proximity to the hiatus at 127.25 mm. "
